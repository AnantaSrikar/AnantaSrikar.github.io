Hey there! It's been a while since my last blog post. The reason for the silence? I've been busy relocating and settling into my new home - the United States! I've embarked on a journey to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I arrived in Blacksburg in mid-August, and it's been roughly two months since I made the move. Adapting to this new environment has been quite the adventure, especially when it comes to making sense of pounds (instead of kilograms), gallons (instead of liters), and miles (instead of kilometers).

This semester, I've dived into three core courses:

- Computer Architecture (ECE 5504): The labs have been a blast. We're diving into emulating a RISC-V processor on Verilator to explore various performance metrics.

- Multiprocessor Programming (ECE 5304): It's been an in-depth exploration of the book "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming."

- Operating Systems (CS 5204): This one's my favorite by far. I'm finally getting my hands on real OS codebase!

I even managed to fit in a solo trip to New York, more about it in a later blog.

On the hardware front, I've expanded my collection:
- Ender 3 V3 SE 3D Printer
- Pixel 8 Pro and a Pixel Watch 2
- Samsung 27" Odyssey G55A QHD 165Hz 1ms FreeSync Curved Monitor
- Flipper Zero
- Brother P-Touch PT-D200 Label Maker

I even had to invest in a new soldering iron because the one I brought from home wasn't compatible with the 110V system here.

Exciting things are constantly happening, and I promise to keep you updated as time goes by. I've realized that I've been doing some really cool stuff, but I haven't been sharing it widely (except for a certain X handle). So, I've decided it's high time I get serious about documenting my work. I have a feeling that my future self will thank me for it!

Stay tuned for more updates and insights into my journey in the world of computer engineering and beyond.
