Hey there! It's been a while since I last gave an update about what I'm working on, which is why I made this blog.

I've been working on Embedded Systems projects over the last two semesters since it's the closest I can get to firmware and device driver development (which is my ultimate goal). It's also a lot easier since I don't have to deal with virtual memory (as opposed to a driver, which runs in an OS) and many other things that are massively simplified.

I also took up Embedded Systems as an elective and aced it! I got a 10 (out of 10) in that course. I enjoyed every bit of it, including the classes, the exams and the course project. I attempted to build a keyboard with custom keybindings for the project. That would be very useful for System Administrators (like myself) and gamers. Due to the scarce access to an oscilloscope, I still need to complete it. But most of it is done, and I will finish it as soon as I get access to an oscilloscope.

I've also started learning PCB design on KiCAD. I'm trying to make a USB Switch using the `FSUSB42MUX` IC. I'm yet to know how to do the routing for the same. PCB designing is one of the most beautiful-looking things I've worked on. Here are some pics for you to experience the awesomeness.

I've also done some basic hostel room automation to automatically turn my UPS on when it trips due to a power surge. I did that using a Raspberry Pi Pico and a servo motor. More info and pics some other day.

So that's about it, for now, folks.

Until next time,\
