After bulding my PC garac, I finally had enough CPU power to try something a little more demanding, like compiling a custom ROM for my phone! I've been using custom ROM on my devices for about 2 years now, and I decided it was time I started taking into my own hand. 

Update: I couldn't continue maintaining the project for my device as it started becoming more difficult to manage
