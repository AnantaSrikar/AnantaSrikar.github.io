For about 4 years, I have been coding in C or C++ with no absolute goal whatsoever. I also did a little Database Management Systems (*MySQL*) and Object Oriented Programming in 12th grade, but haven't applied them in any real-life application. With all this in mind, I decided to try and work on a project that can be used by everyone. I started by trying to make an app. In a few weeks, I figured my way around Android Studio. I made a few basic apps like a calculator, speedometer and flashlight control app. Then, I decided to take it a step up and build a basic chat app.

I learnt more about different `Views` to display various elements of the app. I ended up using Firebase Database for storing user data and the chats. Yes, there was no end-to-end encryption or two-factor authentication, but at least it works! I cut myself some slack since it was the first time I was trying out something like this.

I played around more with my application and added more features like user profiles, DPs and deleting chat. I did consider publishing this app on the play store, but my interest in Android App Development had dwindled by then.
