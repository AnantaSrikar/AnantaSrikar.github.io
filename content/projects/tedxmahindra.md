Around the beginning of the month, my uni's TEDx team was hiring people to organise the event. I was bored and thought it would be a good idea to swoop in and help them however I could. I filled out a Google Form to apply for the same. I was 'interviewed' and got selected to be a part of the technical team.

Since I had prior experience in making websites I thought it would be a good idea for the event to have a website. I also handled various parts of the event, such as the video call with the speakers, streaming and recording the same. The event went much better than expected, given the entire COVID scenario, and we pulled it off in less than a month of preparation and coordination with the speakers.

I also got a T-Shirt for my contribution to the event!
