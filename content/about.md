I enjoy programming. My journey of coding began in my 8th grade when I learnt C. The year later I started learning C++, which went on till my 12<sup>th</sup> grade. I like to automate small, daily tasks. I dream of building a fully self-made automated house, with an AI integration (something like J.A.R.V.I.S.)

# Flashback

I had a deep interest in computers from when I was a kid. I loved playing video games on them. I was intrigued and fascinated by how computers work. Everything changed when I was introduced to the C language. I then made a basic calculator using the switch statements as my first application. From then on, my interest in programming grew immensely. Later, I coded a text-based Hotel management system for my 12th CBSE board exam project coded in C++, used file handling (and got full marks for it!). Later, after my boards, I even developed a Chatting App in Android Studio (basically Java) and Firebase as the online database.


# Current day

I'm currently working for [Futuristic Labs](https://www.getriku.com) as an Embedded Firmware Developer Intern while studying the 8<sup>th</sup> semester in Computer Science at Mahindra École Centrale, Hyderabad.
